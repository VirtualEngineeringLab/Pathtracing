# Pathtracing

This project is William Sokol Erhard's testbed to explore all variety of techniques and approaches to enable realtime pathtracing with XR.

Notable implemented features: steroscopic rendering, planer and depth reprojection, acceleration structures for complex meshes, local multiplatform support for Android & HoloLens, depth buffer, and various denoising techniques among many others.

This is the first publicly shown implementation of AR or VR support for any application capable of raytraced or pathtraced rendering when initialy released in 2019. I created it after a thorough search for existing solutions came up empty.

This project was originally based off of David Kuri's work as found here:

Futher work done by William Sokol Erhard initially at Volkswagen and now independently.
